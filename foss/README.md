*What to do ?*
These are the templates.
I a likely to run into design issues. So, fix them, please.

1. Create a copy of directory *himanshub16* and rename it to your own username.
2. Replace the *profilePic.jpg* by your own profile pic, but keep the filename same.
3. In file *foss.html*, check out for comments <!--flag--> , and modify the content as per your needs.
4. Modify your entry in *home.html* file. Select the card that you like and do the necessary changes.
5. If you don't like any of the colors (which I believe is going to happen),change the color of linear-gradient as you wish, and change the details.

The background-color change will be reflected at : 
* Lines like <div class="vcard" style="background....."> in file *home.html*.
* .topBanner CSS in <head> of *foss.html*.

6. In the *foss.html* file in your directory, change the value of topBanner (linear-gradient) *line 12* to the value in the *home.html* file.

You are done!

In case of any problem or queries, raise an issue or ping me!
